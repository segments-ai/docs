# Export data

To download your labeled data, create a release on the Releases tab of your dataset. A release is a snapshot of your dataset at a specific point in time.

By clicking the download link of a release, you obtain a release file in JSON format. This release file contains all information about the dataset, tasks, samples, and labels in the release.

This section contains information about

1. [The structure of the release file](structure-of-the-release-file.md)
2. [How to export the release file to different formats via the SDK](exporting-image-annotations-to-different-formats.md)

Please refer to [this blog post](https://segments.ai/blog/speed-up-image-segmentation-with-model-assisted-labeling) for an example of training a segmentation model on exported data with some useful code snippets.
