# Work with issues

When labeling or reviewing a sample, you can create a new issue by clicking the ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>) icon in the top navigation bar. The issues functionality works as follows:

* Both labelers and reviewers can open a new issue on a sample. For example, a labeler could open an issue because he's uncertain about how to label something, and a reviewer because he discovered a mistake in a labeled sample.
* When an issue is created, it automatically becomes an "open" issue, as indicated by the red icon.
* Reviewers and admins can "resolve" issues by clicking the checkmark icon. A resolved issue is indicated with a green icon.
* Everyone can add replies to an issue. This allows for back-and-forth communication between labeler and reviewer. Note that rejected samples always go back to the original labeler, and corrected samples go back to the original reviewer.
* Reviewers and admins have access to an issues tab, where they can see the list of all open and resolved issues.
