# Use track IDs in sequences

A **track ID** is an identifier assigned to each labeled object in a [sequence](../../background/main-concepts.md#sequences). This track ID can be used to track an object over multiple frames.

### Add a track ID to an object

When creating an object in a sequence editor, a track ID is automatically created.
