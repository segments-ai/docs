# Use the labeling interfaces

This section contains how-to guides for each of the labeling interfaces:

* [3D point cloud segmentation interface](3d-point-cloud-segmentation-interface.md)
* [3D point cloud cuboid interface](3d-point-cloud-cuboid-interface.md)
* [Image segmentation interface (bitmap)](image-segmentation-interface.md)
* [Image vector interface (bounding box, polygon, polyline, keypoint)](image-vector-interface.md)

Additionally these two guides explain how to use the sequence interfaces:

* [Use track IDs in sequences](use-track-ids-in-sequences.md)
* [Use keyframe interpolation](use-keyframe-interpolation.md)
