# Sensors list

For multi-sensor datasets, the sensors list can be opened and closed with the backtick key (\`) located to the left of the "1" key on a standard US or UK keyboard. This dropdown now also reflects the presence of the active object on a sensor. If the active object is present, a filled circle appears before the sensor name; an empty circle means that the object is not present. \
\
Additionally, hotkeys for navigating through the sensors are displayed on the right side of the sensor name. For example, pressing key **7** will change the view to **Cam back right**. These hotkeys now extend to the second row of the keyboard rather than only the digits. If there are too many sensors, it will not display a hotkey for it.
