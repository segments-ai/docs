# Label sequences of data

Segments.ai allows you to upload a sequence of data as one sample. This way, a single labeler can efficiently label a whole sequence of data. This workflow also allows you to obtain consistent IDs across frames, which is useful for tracking applications. To speed up labeling, you can use keyframe interpolation.

This section contains how-to guides explaining these features in more detail:
