# Track timeline

In order to visualize the tracks across the sequence of frames, you can refer to the track timeline at the bottom of the screen.



As you reach an empty project, you should see an empty timeline.

By default, it is collapsed. You can expand it by clicking on the _`Details`_ button.

## Create a new track

Once you have a label added, the new track will be displayed in the timeline as a colored bar.&#x20;

A keyframe is automatically added on top of the colored track bar at the frame where the state of the object is defined by the user. More details about keyframes [here](use-keyframe-interpolation.md).



## Display tracks

Track bars show when objects are present, using colors that match the object in the scene.

The tracks are now listed individually on the left part of the timeline and are vertically scrollable.

A track is selectable by clicking on its category.&#x20;

The track list is synced with the one on the right side bar.



## Manage tracks

Multiple interactions are available on track timeline tracks. You can select, move, delete, copy, and paste keyframes. More details about keyframes [here](use-keyframe-interpolation.md).

Movement is constrained to the segment where the object exists, so data integrity stays intact.



### Contextual Menu

To access deeper features, you can right click on a track frame in order to:

* Remove the track entirely
* Update the track id. More details [here](use-track-ids-in-sequences.md).



## Navigate across the frames

Frame navigator in the expanded view allows jumping to any frame and object.

You can navigate across the frames using the arrow hotkeys or using the navigation buttons.

The frames are listed on the top part of the timeline and are horizontally scrollable.
