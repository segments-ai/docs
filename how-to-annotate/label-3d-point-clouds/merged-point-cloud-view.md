## Toggle the merged point cloud view

Click on the "layers" icon in the right toolbar to toggle the merged point cloud view.

## For cuboid annotation

When labeling a static object in 3D point cloud sequences, a single frame might not show the object in full detail. It can thus be difficult to assess the full dimensions of an object.

To solve this issue, you can toggle a merged point cloud view.

This video shows how you can use the merged point cloud view to draw a perfect cuboid around a static object.

## For 3D point cloud segmentation

Labeling objects in 3D point cloud sequences is a tedious process. For static objects, you typically have to label the object in each frame separately, which is a waste of time. On Segments.ai, you can simply toggle the merged point cloud view, and then label the object in all frames at once.

{% hint style="info" %}
Segmentation on merged point clouds is currently in closed beta.
