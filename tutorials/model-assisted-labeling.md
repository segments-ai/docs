# Model-assisted labeling

One way to drastically speed up data labeling is by leveraging your machine learning models from the start. Instead of labeling the entire dataset manually, you can use a model to help you by iterating between image labeling and model training.

Segments.ai makes it easy to set up such model-assisted workflows.

We have two interactive tutorials in the form of a Google Colab notebook:

* [Speed up your image segmentation workflow with model-assisted labeling](https://colab.research.google.com/github/segments-ai/fast-labeling-workflow/blob/master/demo.ipynb)
* [Label 3D point clouds more efficiently using pre-labels](https://colab.research.google.com/github/segments-ai/demo-pointcloud-segmentation/blob/main/pc\_pre\_annotations.ipynb)
